# A Flexible Workflow for Interactive Geospatial Mapping

### What is the problem this repo solves?

- Conducting ML-assisted geospatial mapping starting with no labels require a lot of effort.
- Steps: acquiring the satellite images, preparing & processing the imagery, setting up a labeling environment and budget, preparing a compute environment, and finally training the resulting model.
- The required resources makes it difficult to use deep learning models in regions where it is needed most, especially in Africa.

### Why this is an interesting problem?

The need for accelerating such workflows using open-source software, publicly available satellite imagery, and free compute is essential in low-resource environments.

### What do we want to achieve?

In this session, we aim to showcase an end-to-end workflow for mapping objects in satellite imagery using publicly available resources with minimal costs on the user.

### What follows from the workflow?

You can adapt & customize the workflow to your needs. You can build on it to make it easier to be used to empower geospatial machine learning applications in the continent.
